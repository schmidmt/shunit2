shUnit2 is a [xUnit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) unit test framework for Bourne based shell scripts, and it is designed to work in a similar manner to [JUnit](http://junit.org/), [PyUnit](http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/), etc. If you have ever had the desire to write a unit test for a shell script, shUnit2 can do the job.
